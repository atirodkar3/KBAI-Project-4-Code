The File is made in Python 2.7 and incorporates Numpy, Scipy and the Python Image Library (PIL). The second Propositional Part is in Java 6.

To download the required libraries, please go to:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

To run the code:

1. Unzip the File
2. First, run the project4.py file from the Command Prompt or otherwise. This will now generate the Representations. This is a PYTHON FILE.
Merely run the Aditya_Tirodkar_Project4_Prop_Rep.jar file to get the answers displayed. This is a Java 6 file. For any runtime errors, please contact me.


All Input Image Templates are in Data1 Folder. They are already pre-sorted here though the data folder is essentially meant to have em sorted.
All input images are in folders 1 to 12.
All Python Code is in project4.py
All Java Code is in SourceCode/Project2


For Problem 11 and 12, if any content is to be added, I will zip up and send the DATA1 and DATA folders along with folders 11 and 12.
Currently, these folders contain problems 9 and 10.
Representation files are created once the Python File is run. Repeated iterations overwrite the file.

PROBLEM 12 USUALLY TAKES LONGER TO RUN.
